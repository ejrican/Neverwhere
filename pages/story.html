      <h1>NeverWhere</h1>
      <p>
        In a land known as Shadowdale, the adventure did commence with Kael,
        Brocc, and Apollo as its protagonists. Brocc, a known gnome of 40 years,
        was of small stature, standing at four feet tall and weighing 40 pounds.
        As a 5th Level moon druid, he possessed a particular skill set. Kael, on
        the other hand, was a towering human, standing seven feet tall and known
        for his immense strength as a mountain barbarian. Despite his
        intimidating size, he had a gentle nature. Apollo, the third adventurer,
        stood at 6 feet 4 inches and was a highly knowledgeable human bard with
        a talent for storytelling and a charismatic singing voice. As they
        entered this new world, each adventurer met Aumry, who had appeared
        suddenly and individually before them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Aumry led each adventurer to Shadowdale, they were greeted by
        Malagar, a figure of mystery and intrigue. Brocc's memory was jogged as
        he recalled a tale he had heard about an Arch Mage of Waterdeep by the
        same name, who was rumored to have met his end in a cave-in while
        worshipping the god of death, Myrkul. Could this be the same Malagar?
      </p>
      <div class="character__card left">
        <div class="imageprofile">
          <img src="../assets/sylune_Silverhand.svg" alt="Sylune Silverhand" />
        </div>
        <h2>Sylune Silverhand</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The group soon encountered Malagar inside a tavern in Shadowdale, where
        Sylune served as the bartender and El Minister as a waiter. It was there
        that Malagar revealed that he needed their help in negotiating the
        release of Pan the Gnome, who was being held captive by Penny Eyesore in
        the city's sewers. Pan held information that could prove to be useful,
        and Malagar believed that the group was capable of securing his release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the team made their way through the underground sewer system, Apollo
        remarked on the unusual presence of such infrastructure in the
        farmlands. He noted that the world seemed to be out of sorts, not as it
        once was. Indeed, things seemed to be amiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, the group located Penny in the underground market and
        successfully negotiated for the release of both Pan and Rictor the
        Lucky. Kael offered up memories in exchange for their freedom, and the
        deal was struck. Kael's decision to exchange his memories in order to
        secure the release of Pan and Rictor proved to have negative
        consequences for him later in the journey. As the group continued on
        their quest, Kael found that he was struggling to remember important
        details about their mission and the world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rictor, a human thief, seemed to be more aware of the strangeness of
        their situation than the others. He informed the group that they were
        indeed in Waterdeep, and went on to reveal some interesting information
        about the people they had encountered. According to Rictor, Sylune was
        known as The Witch of Shadowdale, and El Minister was a master wizard
        who protected the land. Clearly, there was much more to this world than
        they had initially realized.

      </div>
      <p>
        And so it was that the team completed their mission and delivered Pan to
        the enigmatic figure of Malagar. The two held a private conversation,
        the contents of which remained a mystery to the rest of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Malagar tasked the team with a new mission, one that would
        take them to the fabled city of Tyrus and the retrieval of a powerful
        relic. With Pan in tow, the team set out on their journey, unaware that
        they were being secretly followed by the treacherous Penny Eyesore.

      <p>
        As they travelled, the team remained ever-vigilant, alert to the dangers
        that lurked around every corner. And yet, despite the many obstacles
        they faced, they remained steadfast in their determination to see the
        mission through to its successful completion. For they knew that the
        fate of the world hung in the balance, and that they alone held the key
        to its salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the team of adventurers made their way towards the city of Tyrus,
        they felt a pull towards a mysterious figure known as Grem Pond, whose
        words carried a dark and enigmatic truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the team knew of Grem Pond's evil nature and his tendency towards
        deceit, they could not resist the urge to seek out his knowledge, for
        they believed that he may hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of
        this strange and unfamiliar world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With trepidation in their hearts, the team approached Grem Pond, ready
        to hear his ominous warnings and foreboding prophecies. And as they
        listened to his words, they could feel the weight of truth bearing down
        upon them, even as they struggled to make sense of the dark and
        unsettling revelations he offered.
      </p>
      <div class="character__card right">

      </div>
      <p>
        For Grem Pond suggested that the very fabric of reality had been
        rewritten, that the events of the past were being reshaped in ways that
        threatened to upend the order of the world itself. And though the team
        could not fully comprehend the implications of his words, they knew that
        they must press on, for the fate of the world rested on their shoulders,
        and the journey ahead would be fraught with danger and uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        After entering Tyrus The Wall city, the team found themselves surrounded
        by structures with an appearance of early day construction. Unfinished
        buildings and bare frames only added to the eeriness of the abandoned
        city. Nonetheless, they ventured forth through the city and nearby
        Dwarven Caves in search of the relic. Finally, their efforts were
        rewarded as they discovered the object of their quest - a small wooden
        sword, currently sheathed.

      </div>
      <p>
        In the midst of a heated battle in Tyrus, Pan becomes increasingly
        suspicious of Malagar's intentions and absconds with the small wooden
        sword. As the team struggles to fend off their attackers, Penny Eyesore
        unexpectedly arrives and aids them in their fight. It is then revealed
        that Penny has been covertly tailing the group, but her true intentions
        remain unclear. As the dust settles, the team realizes that Pan has
        vanished along with the precious relic, and they set out on a perilous
        quest to locate him and uncover the truth behind their mysterious
        companions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penny, a small but violent creature, reveals to the team that Pan has
        decided to take the wooden sword to the Ice Queen himself, as he does
        not trust Malagar. The Ice Queen is known for her gentle nature and
        immense power, and she also happens to be Penny's sister. Despite the
        danger of traveling north to the Ice Queen's territory, Penny offers to
        guide the team through treacherous terrain and harsh weather conditions.
        The team sets off on their journey with Penny leading the way,
        determined to reach the Ice Queen and retrieve the wooden sword from
        Pan's grasp.

        <h2>Babel - Worlds Best Detective</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        As they reached their destination, Pan was found attempting to deliver
        the sacred wooden sword relic to the Ice Queen, causing a stir among the
        team. Penny, being the skilled negotiator, steps up to the plate and
        bargains with her sister on behalf of Pan and the precious sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ice Queen agreed to the terms of Penny's negotiation, she handed
        over Pan and the wooden sword relic to the team. However, the playful
        mocking between the two sisters quickly turned sour when Brocc, a member
        of the team, misunderstood the situation and cast an Entanglement spell
        on Penny.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to the spell, Penny swiftly took Brocc's life, leaving the
        team in shock and disbelief. But just as all seemed lost, Apollo, using
        his skill in negotiation, offered to exchange one of his memories in
        return for Brocc's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the deal struck, Apollo's memory was taken, and Brocc was revived.
        The team couldn't help but feel grateful for Apollo's selflessness and
        were now more determined than ever to complete their quest. The
        fellowship was led back to Shadowdale where they presented Pan and the
        wooden relic sword to Malagar, who then drew forth the blade, and thus
        set free Sylune, El Minister, and Penny Eyesore from their beguilement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Penny Rictor and the Kenku, they departed on their own accord,
        with Penny proclaiming that she had found a new realm in which to sow
        her wickedness. El Minister, on the other hand, withdrew to seclusion in
        a tower, where he remained locked away from the world and its affairs.
        As for Sylune, she made her way back to Shadowdale, where she resumed
        her duties and continued to aid the people of the land as best she
        could.

      <p>
        The world is not the same has been the them of this adventure so far. As
        the wooden sword was unsheathed, Malagar and his companions were struck
        by a startling revelation - a Wizard named Pyatt had been manipulating
        time and space in his desperate search for his lost love. The
        consequences of his actions had drawn in a multitude of people from
        various places and times, and the situation seemed dire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pyatt's love was the only one for him, and she could be located anywhere
        in the vast expanse of time and space. It fell upon the team to halt his
        machinations and restore reality to its rightful state, but the task
        before them was daunting, and the odds were not in their favor. The fate
        of all that was and ever would be hung in the balance, and the team knew
        that they must prevail, no matter the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the chaos and confusion, a glimmer of hope emerged - Pyatt's
        associates, known as the Secret Seven, may be able to lend aid to the
        team in their quest. But the path to their assistance was arduous, for
        they were scheduled to attend a gathering to which the team had not been
        invited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Undeterred, they were advised to seek out Talim, a courageous female
        Drow who fought tirelessly to change the negative perceptions
        surrounding her people and elevate them to a new social standing. Talim
        resided in the city's perilous sewers, and she was the key to securing
        the coveted invitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With determination etched upon their faces and their spirits emboldened
        by the promise of assistance, the team ventured into the labyrinthine
        tunnels, their eyes fixed on the future and the challenges that lay
        ahead. For they knew that in this quest, as in all things, hope and
        perseverance were their greatest allies.

      <p>
        Deep within the treacherous underdark, the team encountered unexpected
        allies in the form of Jai Kai and RaZaa. Jai Kai was a towering figure,
        standing at a height of six feet, with the visage of a fierce and
        uncompromising human cleric. He was a devoted follower of Eldith, and
        his zeal knew no bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        RaZaa, on the other hand, was a hulking Dragonborn, towering over all
        those around him at a staggering seven feet tall. His presence commanded
        respect and awe, and his fighting prowess was the stuff of legend. Yet,
        despite his formidable reputation, he was suddenly summoned back to his
        home plane by a higher power, and disappeared without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team could not help but wonder at the sudden disappearance of their
        new ally, but they knew that their mission was far from over. With
        renewed determination, they pressed forward, facing the challenges of
        the underdark with unwavering resolve. For they knew that every step
        they took brought them closer to their goal - the salvation of reality
        from Pyatt's mad schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the team finally found Talim, they were met with a sobering sight -
        the fearless Drow freedom fighter was battered and bruised, her spirit
        undaunted but her body clearly weakened by her struggles. Brocc, ever
        the compassionate healer, attempted to tend to her wounds, but she
        remained on guard, her eyes scanning the surroundings for any potential
        threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In time, she revealed the source of her injuries and her anger - Xander,
        a former ally and trusted comrade, had betrayed her and taken six of her
        fellow soldiers with him. It was a heinous act, one that could not be
        tolerated, and Talim made it clear that she would not rest until justice
        was served.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pact was struck between the team and Talim - they would help her track
        down Xander and put an end to his treachery, in exchange for the coveted
        invitation they needed to reach the Secret Seven. It was a dangerous
        mission, fraught with peril and uncertainty, but the team knew that they
        had no choice but to see it through. For their journey had become a
        quest for honor and redemption, one that would test their mettle and
        their resolve to their very limits.

        With their sights set on bringing Xander to justice, the team set out to
        locate the traitorous Drow in the depths of the sewers. After a grueling
        search, they finally located him at the North East corner of the dank
        and dangerous labyrinth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team's true motivations were revealed when they made a treacherous
        move against Talim, breaking her trust and striking a deal with Xander
        instead. In a shocking turn of events, they traded the coveted magical
        invitation for the whereabouts of Talim, leaving the valiant freedom
        fighter vulnerable to her enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a moment of profound moral ambiguity, a decision that would weigh
        heavy on the team's conscience for days and weeks to come. But in that
        moment, they chose their own interests over the greater good, and sealed
        their fate as dishonorable mercenaries rather than noble heroes. The
        quest had taken a dark turn, and the road ahead was shrouded in shadow
        and uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        After delivering the mystical invitation to Malagar and being granted a
        brief sojourn, the crew attempted to withdraw from the perilous
        adventures that had become their way of life. Alas, their rest was
        short-lived, for Thurbal, the vigilant warden of Shadowdale, summoned
        Kael and company to undertake a reconnaissance mission in the deserted
        tunnels beneath the castle. Reluctantly, the team accepted the call to
        action, knowing that their skills would be needed once more to confront
        the unknown dangers that lay ahead. As they prepare to meet with
        Thurbal, Apollo and the rest of the team felt the weight of their past
        triumphs and failures, and the uncertainty of the future that awaited
        each companion. Nonetheless, their resolve remained strong, and they
        ventured forth, ready to face whatever lay in store.

        As the team made their way to meet Thurbal, they couldn't help but
        notice that the world around them was in a constant state of flux.
        Buildings and landscapes seemed to change before their very eyes, a sure
        sign that Pyatt was still up to his tricks. Upon reaching Thurbal, they
        were given a mission to explore the abandoned tunnels beneath the
        castle. Thurbal had reason to suspect that something was stirring down
        there, and he needed the team to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a dangerous mission, fraught with peril and uncertainty. But the
        team knew that they couldn't sit idly by while their world was being
        torn apart. They accepted the task and ventured into the depths of the
        tunnels, bracing themselves for whatever lay ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team ventured deeper into the Under Dark, they faced numerous
        challenges in their attempt to locate the Drow hideout. The Dark Elves
        proved to be formidable opponents, testing the crew's skills and
        determination at every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the team's struggles were not limited to their encounters with the
        denizens of the Under Dark. Rumors of their treacherous betrayal of
        Talim had spread like wildfire, casting a shadow of doubt over their
        mission and endangering their already perilous journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team stumbled upon a lifeless Drow during their journey through the
        Under Dark. To their surprise, Brocc discovered a note on the corpse
        that contained critical information for Talim. The letter indicated that
        someone had successfully infiltrated the house of Telenna, whose members
        were sympathetic to the idea of freeing the Drow from their oppressive
        ways. These individuals believed in Talim's vision of unity and harmony,
        where they would no longer enslave others and wreak havoc upon the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the note warned Talim of the treacherous Xander, a Drow who
        only craved money and destruction. The author of the letter advised her
        to be cautious when dealing with him. Lastly, the writer inquired about
        rumors of Talim's allegiance to the demi-god, Penni Eyesore, known for
        being the embodiment of violence. The letter suggested that seeking
        righteous violence through Penni Eyesore's avatar was a miracle and that
        Talim had achieved wonders for their people.

        The Under Dark proved to be a treacherous place, with many enemies
        standing in the team's way. However, they were a skilled group, and
        their prowess in battle allowed them to overcome every obstacle. Apollo
        was particularly invaluable, casting powerful spells that allowed the
        team to move stealthily through the tunnels. On several occasions, his
        invisibility spells saved them from certain doom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Brocc proved to be an expert at navigating the twisting
        tunnels of the Under Dark. He left marks on the walls, creating a trail
        that would lead them straight to the hidden Drow entrance. Even in the
        darkness, Brocc's keen senses never failed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to their efforts, the team was greatly aided by Jai Kai and
        Kael, who utilized their combat skills to devastating effect in battle
        against the Dark Elves. Jai Kai's devotion to Eldith, the goddess of
        peace and patron of clerics, gave him a calm and serene demeanor in even
        the most intense combat situations, while Kael's sharp instincts and
        impressive combat technique proved invaluable time and time again.
        Together with Apollo and Brocc, the team forged ahead into the depths of
        the Under Dark, determined to uncover the rumored drow entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the team ventured through the treacherous Underdark, they stumbled
        upon a pair of undead ogres, their rotting flesh and glowing eyes an
        ominous sight. The creatures, sensing the presence of intruders,
        launched a fierce attack against the team. During the brutal battle, the
        sharp-eyed Brocc spotted a vial of liquid hanging from the neck of one
        of the ogres, secured by a pendant. Using his druidic powers, Brocc
        transformed into a nimble spider and stealthily crawled onto the ogre's
        back. Swiftly, he returned to his true form, snatched the pendant, and
        leapt off the ogre's back.

        <h2>Gnomeh Lisa</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        In a valiant display of martial prowess, Kael struck down the ogre,
        sending it crashing to the ground in a heap. The team emerged
        victorious, but the question lingered: what was the significance of the
        mysterious liquid? Lo and behold, a solitary undead ogre still lingered
        in their midst. Brocc, ever the stalwart companion, did not hesitate to
        lend his aid. From the depths of these very tunnels he had procured a
        vial of luminous green liquid, which he now flung with all his might.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the glowing liquid splashed upon the ogre, it took on a most peculiar
        hue - a radiant green that illuminated the darkness like a beacon.
        Though the creature remained unscathed, the comical glow it now emitted
        proved a boon to the weary adventurers, who were at last able to discern
        its movements in the gloom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brocc, his mind racing with thoughts of victory, grasped another vial
        from his pack - one that he had taken from the fallen ogre they had
        dispatched earlier. Surely this one, he thought, would bring about the
        creature's doom.
      </p>
      <p>
        But alas, fate had other plans. For as the vial shattered upon impact
        with the undead ogre, a sickening realization overtook Brocc. This was
        not the green liquid he had expected - no, this was a vile concoction of
        Penny Eyesore's own blood, harvested by the ogres for reasons unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the green glow intensified and the creature began to swell, Brocc
        knew that he had made a grave mistake. The undead ogre, now a towering
        monstrosity of muscle and bone, loomed over the hapless adventurer like
        a force of nature. One could scarcely believe the transformation that
        had taken place before their very eyes - it was as if the creature had
        drawn upon some primal, malevolent power that lurked within the very
        earth itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In vain did Brocc and his companions attempt to fend off the beast. Its
        blows rained down upon them like thunder, shaking the very foundations
        of the tunnels. And as they retreated, battered and bloodied, they knew
        that their fate now lay in the hands of a force beyond their reckoning.
        For the undead ogre was no longer a mere monster - it had become
        something far more terrifying, a living embodiment of death and
        destruction.
      </p>

        </div>
        <h2>The Van Cross</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The monster's deep, rumbling voice echoed through the tunnels as it
        spoke, its eyes burning with a fierce, malevolent light. "I am the Scion
        of Penny," it boomed, its voice filled with an eerie, otherworldly
        power. "Covered in the blood of the avatar of violence, I have been
        reborn as a force to be reckoned with. You mortals are no match for me."
        As the creature spoke, its massive frame loomed over the team, casting
        them into shadow. Its skin, once a sickly green, now glowed with an
        unearthly radiance, pulsing with a life force that seemed to defy the
        laws of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, the team stood frozen in terror, staring up at the monster
        in awe. But then, with a sudden burst of courage, Jai Kai stepped
        forward. "We may be mortals," he said, his voice shaking with fear, "but
        we are not so easily defeated. We will fight you with every ounce of our
        strength given to us by Eldith, and we will not rest until you are
        vanquished." The Scion of Penny bellowed with laughter, its massive form
        shaking the tunnels. "Foolish mortal," it said. "Your courage is
        admirable, but it will not save you. I am the embodiment of death and
        destruction, and I will not rest until all who oppose me are crushed
        beneath my feet."
      </p>
      <p>
        And with that, the monster launched itself at the team, its massive
        fists pounding the ground with each step. Despite their best efforts,
        the team found themselves outmatched by the Scion of Penny's sheer
        strength and ferocity. As they struggled to fend off the monster's
        relentless attacks, panic began to set in. But then, in a stroke of
        brilliance, Brocc cast a thunderclap spell that sent the creature
        reeling backwards, its massive frame slamming against the tunnel wall
        with a deafening crash. Seizing the opportunity, Jai Kai unleashed an
        Eldith blast that struck the ceiling above, causing it to collapse in a
        shower of stone and debris. The Scion of Penny let out a thunderous roar
        as it was buried beneath the rubble, its immense strength no match for
        the weight of the earth and stone that now bore down upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team watched in stunned silence as the dust settled, unsure of
        whether their foe had been truly vanquished. But as the echoes of the
        thunderclap and the collapsing ceiling faded into the darkness, it
        became clear that the Scion of Penny was no more. Yet the victory was
        bittersweet, for the noise of their battle had echoed far beyond the
        confines of the tunnels. The team knew that their presence had been
        revealed, and that they were now in grave danger. With a heavy heart,
        they gathered their gear and set off into the unknown depths of the
        underdark, hoping against hope that they would find a way to escape the
        horrors that lay ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of their travels, the band stumbled upon Simon The Stone
        Breaker, a stout dwarf whose company had been ruthlessly decimated by a
        noxious creature emanating an eerie green luminescence, which identified
        itself as the Scion of Penny. The team, mindful of their culpability in
        the genesis of the beast, endeavored to conceal their prior knowledge
        and feigned ignorance of the creature's identity and nature in their
        interactions with Simon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst their arduous journey through the nether reaches, the valiant
        troupe found themselves embroiled in a ceaseless skirmish against
        ghastly denizens of the under dark and the treacherous machinations of
        the Drow. Yet, amidst the fray, the team fell prey to the duplicitous
        ways of Zeek, one of Talim's "children", who cunningly posed as a guide
        and pledged his aid to the cause. Unbeknownst to the team, Zeek led them
        astray, straight into a perilous trap that nearly cost them their very
        lives.

      <p>
        But by virtue of their resourcefulness and resilience, the team managed
        to cheat death and escape the clutches of their would-be assailants.
        Though their trials and tribulations were far from over, they pressed on
        with renewed fortitude, steadfast in their quest to see it through to
        its fated end.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the unyielding depths of the Under Dark, the brave champions were
        beset by unspeakable horrors, each battling fiercely and sustaining
        grievous wounds in the process. Alas, the price of their heroic
        endeavors was steep, for it was with heavy hearts that they mourned the
        loss of one of their own, Jai Kai. Jai Kai met his untimely demise in a
        brutal onslaught, beset upon by a horde of merciless adversaries who
        overwhelmed him and dragged him away, destined for a grisly fate as
        their repast. Despite the best efforts of his companions to recover his
        remains, Jai Kai's body was beyond reach, lost forevermore in the
        abyssal depths of the Under Dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        His passing weighed heavily on the team, their spirits dampened by the
        loss of their comrade and the cruel realities of their perilous journey.
        But still, they forged ahead, determined to see their quest through to
        the end and to honor Jai Kai's memory with every step they took. With
        great perseverance and unwavering courage, the dauntless fellowship at
        last succeeded in traversing the treacherous caverns of the Under Dark
        and emerged into the light of day. As they drew nigh to the entrance -
        the very threshold through which they had ventured into the abyssal
        depths - their eyes beheld a strange and wondrous sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        For there, before them, the portal lay agape, sundered asunder by some
        unfathomable force. The team beheld the ragged edges of the fissure, the
        scars of the violent upheaval etched deep into the very fabric of the
        earth itself. Uncertain of the cause or implications of this strange
        occurrence, the team steeled themselves for whatever new dangers might
        await them beyond the threshold. And yet, as they emerged into the light
        of day, the team found themselves beset by a new and unexpected threat.
        For there, waiting to greet them, was Thurbal and his vast army, arrayed
        for battle and bristling with malice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a tense and guarded exchange, Thurbal revealed that a monstrous
        entity - wreathed in a sickly green glow - had burst forth from the
        Under Dark only hours prior, unleashing devastation and laying waste to
        fully half of Thurbal's forces. The creature, Thurbal explained, had
        identified itself as the Scion of Penny before vanishing into the wilds
        beyond. Though the team remained steadfast and resolute, they concealed
        the truth of their involvement in the creation of the creature, feigning
        ignorance and surprise at the revelation. For they knew that their true
        allegiance must remain shrouded in secrecy, lest their mission be
        compromised and their very lives put at risk.
      </p>
      <div class="character__card left">

        </div>
        <h2>Cu-Chulainn</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Alas, fate would not smile upon the team for long. Even as they sought
        to evade the scrutiny of Thurbal and his minions, a chance encounter
        with a Drow would cast their fortunes into peril once again. For the
        Drow, a spy in Thurbal's ranks, recognized the team and relayed his
        suspicions to the warlord, casting the team's allegiance into doubt and
        putting them at grave risk. With no other recourse, the team fled to the
        safety of Malagar's stronghold, seeking refuge and respite from the
        storm of conflict and betrayal that swirled about them. And yet, even
        here, the weight of their actions would bear down upon them, for they
        knew that their hand in the creation of the Scion of Penny could not
        long remain a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they made their confession to Malagar, the gravity of their
        transgression weighed heavy on their hearts, for they knew that the
        consequences of their actions could prove dire indeed. And so, with
        heavy hearts, they resolved to leave the town and seek sanctuary
        elsewhere, lest the wrath of the townsfolk be visited upon them for
        their role in unleashing such a monstrous entity upon the world. And so
        it was that Malagar led the team on a perilous journey, away from the
        dangers of Malagar's stronghold and into the wilds beyond. Their path
        took them across vast and uncharted territories, fraught with danger and
        teeming with the unknown. But at long last, they arrived at their
        destination: a humble farming village, tucked away in a forgotten corner
        of the multiverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was Shadyvale, a place where magic was shunned and reviled, a place
        where the very mention of spells and sorcery was met with fear and
        suspicion. Here, the team would find sanctuary from the wrath of those
        who sought to punish them for their role in the creation of the Scion of
        Penny, and here they would make their stand against the forces of
        darkness that threatened to consume them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Malagar knew that keeping a low profile was of utmost importance if
        the team was to avoid detection and stay alive. And so, he advised them
        to keep their abilities hidden, to blend in with the simple folk of
        Shadyvale, and to never draw attention to themselves. For in this town,
        the slightest hint of magic could mean the difference between life and
        death. And so, the team resolved to bide their time, to train and
        prepare themselves for the battles that lay ahead, and to stay ever
        vigilant against the forces of evil that threatened to undo them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the idyllic township of Shadyvale, the intrepid company happened upon
        an itinerant troupe of performers, offering them gainful employment
        during their travels. As they toiled under the big top, the fellowship
        encountered a stout hill dwarf by the name of Willixe, who shared their
        unyielding devotion to the great Eldith. The diminutive warrior regaled
        them with his story of awakening in this strange and unfamiliar realm,
        bereft of all that he held dear. Driven by the hope of returning to his
        homeland, Willixe eagerly joined the band of adventurers in their quest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malagar explained to the team that he had done all he could but was
        unable to fully doctor the invitation. They would have to enlist the aid
        of Abel, a skilled forger who had turned his life around and dedicated
        himself to the god of Denar, the deity of writing and the written word.
        Abel had taken up residence at the Montelegro Monastery, a place of
        peace and contemplation nestled in the hills beyond Shadyvale. There, he
        lived a simple life, free from the temptations and dangers of the
        outside world, and devoted himself to his craft.

        <h2>Brocc The Half Gram</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The team knew that they could trust Abel to help them, for he was a man
        of honor and integrity, a man who had found redemption and purpose in
        the service of his god. And so, they set out on the long and treacherous
        journey to the monastery, their hearts filled with hope and
        determination, and their minds fixed on the task that lay before them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For they knew that their success or failure depended on Abel's skill and
        expertise, and they were determined to see their mission through to the
        end, no matter the cost. The team made their way through the winding
        paths and treacherous terrain of the hills, their minds fixed on the
        task that lay ahead. As they journeyed on, they came across a young
        priest in the making, a boy named Froyd Lightheart. Froyd was on his
        pilgrimage, a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening that was
        a rite of passage for those who followed his particular faith. Apollo
        recognized the signs of Froyd's religion and, as was customary, offered
        the young boy food as a sign of goodwill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Froyd accepted the food gratefully, and the team spent some time with
        him, learning about his journey and sharing stories of their own
        adventures. They found him to be a kind and gentle soul, full of hope
        and faith, and they felt a kinship with him that went beyond words. But
        their mission was urgent, and they knew that they could not delay for
        long. And so, after bidding farewell to Froyd, they set out once more on
        their journey, their hearts heavy with the knowledge that they had a
        difficult task ahead of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For they knew that convincing Abel to help them would not be easy, and
        that they would have to use all of their wits and charm to win him over.
        But they were determined to succeed, no matter what obstacles lay in
        their path. In the chronicles of Froyd's legend, a noble deed didst
        traverse a great distance and left an indelible imprint upon his soul,
        henceforth elevating the camaraderie of the company to a cherished
        level. Regrettably, this display of magnanimity proved to be Apollo's
        final benevolence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following their departure from Froyd's domain, the company stumbled upon
        a tranquil pond, whose waters mirrored the skies above, and within its
        serene embrace lay the scattered remnants of a creature that bore an
        eerie semblance to a dragon. As fate would have it, the company's
        respite by the tranquil pond was brief, for they were suddenly assailed
        by a swarm of harpies that descended upon them with ferocity. The
        skirmish unfolded amidst a wild magic zone, where the very fabric of
        reality seemed to twist and churn with unpredictable force.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of the chaos, Apollo valiantly attempted to wield his
        magical powers, hoping to sway the tide of battle in his companions'
        favor. Alas, the capricious nature of wild magic proved to be his
        undoing, and a surge of arcane energy caused the ground to crumble
        beneath his feet. The resulting chasm swiftly filled with water from the
        pond, sealing Apollo's fate in a watery grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grief-stricken, the team mourned the loss of their fallen comrade and
        laid him to rest in a nearby patch of earth, offering him a solemn
        farewell befitting of a true hero. And so they continued on their
        journey, forever carrying the memory of Apollo and the sacrifices he
        made in their quest for glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the solemn rites of burial, Brocc carefully retrieved a locket
        that had belonged to Apollo. The locket held within it two precious
        mementos - images that were dear to Apollo's heart. One was a portrait
        of Apollo's beloved, a fair maiden whose memory had kept him steadfast
        through many a hardship. The other was a depiction of Cu-Chulainn,
        Apollo's brother, a valiant warrior who had met his untimely demise
        while facing the fearsome might of an owl bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brocc gazed upon the images with a deep sense of reverence, knowing that
        they were among the few remnants of the fallen hero that would forever
        live on. He carefully stowed the locket away, determined to keep it safe
        and honor the legacy of his fallen comrade. And so the journey
        continued, with the memory of Apollo and his loved ones spurring the
        team forward, ever onward towards the unknown horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the monastery, the fellowship encounters Brother Abbott Aslam, the
        venerable head priest. It is revealed that Abel has passed away, and the
        fellowship joins in the quest to uncover the truth behind his death.
        Through their inquiry, they discover that Brother Horatio, one of the
        monks residing in the monastery, is the perpetrator of Abel's murder.
        The wraith of Abel, awakened from the grave, seeks vengeance against
        Brother Horatio and all those who wronged him during his time at
        Montelegro Monastery. In the end, after Brother Horatio and his
        accomplices are vanquished by Abel's wrathful spirit, the spirit departs
        from the mortal realm.

        As the fellowship bade farewell to Brother Aslam, he proffered a
        suggestion that they journey to Carbone to seek out Abel's brother
        Babel. Babel, too, was a skilled forger and perhaps could lend his
        expertise to aid the fellowship in their quest to have their magical
        invitation doctored. Before embarking on their journey, Brother Aslam
        made a humble entreaty. A wayfarer had taken refuge in the monastery,
        but alas, his sojourn had come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        With compassion in his heart, Brother Aslam beseeched the fellowship to
        extend their benevolence and permit the lost traveler to accompany them
        on their quest. The fellowship, recognizing the virtue of Brother
        Aslam's plea, assented to his request and welcomed their new comrade,
        Mania the Changeling, to their company. Mania, in his true guise,
        appeared as a Mind Flayer, but revealed that he was afflicted with a
        terrible curse that caused him to take on this unnatural form. In the
        interest of avoiding undue attention during their travels, Mania chose
        to assume the appearance of Kael, albeit with tresses flowing like a
        river of gold.

        Thusly disguised, the fellowship departed for Carbone, with Mania now

        As I weave the tale of adventure and intrigue, let me take you to
        Carbone where our team of intrepid travelers has just arrived. Alas,
        their hearts are heavy with the weight of uncertainty, for they know not
        where their quarry, the elusive Babel, may be found. Undaunted, they
        embark on a quest to discover his whereabouts, combing the city's
        streets and gathering clues with great care. Despite their tireless
        efforts, the object of their search remains elusive, taunting them from
        the shadows of secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is amidst this turmoil that they chance upon a scene of violence and
        injustice, as a young lad is set upon by a group of nefarious
        individuals. Quick to defend the innocent, Kale leaps into action, his
        fists flying as he takes on the thugs with all his might. In the heat of
        the fray, Kale throws one of the assailants towards a bystander, who
        turns out to be none other than an elite orc guard of one of Carbone's
        most prestigious families. The authorities were called to the scene by
        Essio and Onrag (the two orcs), but to their dismay, it was Kale who was
        accused of wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, the events that transpired there were fraught with peril and
        unexpected twists, leaving our brave team of adventurers reeling from
        the shock. For you see, amidst the chaos and confusion, there were two
        individuals who stood out like beacons of controversy. The first was
        Mania, whose penchant for public nudity was a constant source of scandal
        and embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then there was Kale, a man of great skill and strength, but also of
        violent tendencies. His actions on the streets of Carbone were a
        double-edged sword, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies, but
        also causing unrest and upheaval amongst the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these two figures were a potent force of chaos, causing
        unfavorable events to occur and leaving our team in a state of disarray
        and also incarcerated in Carbone Prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recounting the street battle between Kale and the Orcs and amidst the
        chaos and confusion, our young druid Brocc was able to slip away in wolf
        form, using his cunning and wit to evade capture.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, even as he made his escape, our team continued to face one
        obstacle after another. For they had learned of Babel's whereabouts,
        only to discover that he too had been incarcerated for reasons unknown.
        It seemed that no matter where they turned, the forces of darkness were
        conspiring against them, seeking to thwart their every move.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even in the face of such adversity, our heroes did not falter. For
        they knew that in times of trouble, it was the strength of their will
        and the depth of their courage that would ultimately prevail. And so,
        with this in mind, Brocc made the decision to leave his companions and
        make his way to visit the family by the name of Van Cross, who resided
        towards the northern part of Carbone and could perhaps assist with
        unlocking the chackles that restrain the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentin and Helena Van Cross were among the most prestigious families
        in all of Carbone, their wealth and power unparalleled by any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, it was to this family that Brocc turned, seeking their aid in
        securing the release of Babel from his unjust imprisonment. With his
        druidic powers at the ready, Brocc negotiated a deal with the Van Cross
        family, one that would require the team to locate Wilham, the Van Cross
        child, within 24 hours in exchange for Babel's release.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a task that would require all of their skills and ingenuity, for
        time was of the essence and failure was not an option. And yet, our
        heroes were undaunted, for they knew that the fate of their future
        rested in their hands. But even as they worked towards their goal, Brocc
        knew that their journey was far from over. For they still owed a debt to
        the Van Cross family for the release of Kale, and they had yet to make
        amends with the family of the orc guards who had been assaulted by their
        companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brocc, the young druidic member of the team, was entrusted with the
        daunting task of settling their debts with the Van Cross family.
        However, fate had other plans in store for them. As they located Wilham,
        they were heartbroken to find him dead, but with the mystical scroll
        provided by the Van Cross family, Brocc was able to bring him back to
        life.

        <h2>Brother Abbott Aslam</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        But the joy of Wilham's revival was short-lived, as he accused Katherine
        Chambers of being responsible for his death. The Van Cross family,
        consumed by their grief and anger, demanded that the team execute
        Katherine as punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their doubts and inner turmoil, Brocc carried out the sentence,
        but to everyone's surprise, Katherine's body did not perish. It was then
        revealed that Katherine was, in fact, a Revenant, and her spirit had
        escaped from her body. With this revelation, it became clear that
        Katherine was innocent of the accusations that had been laid against
        her. The team was left with a heavy heart, realizing that they had made
        a grave mistake in carrying out the Van Cross family's orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        They knew that they had to set things right and clear Katherine's name,
        but they also knew that the path ahead would not be easy. For they had
        angered a powerful family as well as The Revenant Katherine, and their
        actions had consequences that could not be undone easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team made a fateful decision not to accompany the Van Cross family
        to their estate, realizing the danger that lay in following them
        further. However, their mission to secure Babel's release from
        imprisonment was successful, and they were finally able to obtain the
        much-needed forgery of the invitation that would grant them access to
        the event they had been tasked to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fitting that I should reintroduce Cu-Chulainn into our narrative.
        As I recounted earlier, Coo had met his end while valiantly battling an
        Owl Bear, yet here he now appears before us. Cu-Chulainn spoke of a
        similar encounter with an Owl Bear, though he recalls little beyond the
        confrontation, waking suddenly in an unfamiliar land.

      <p>
        Somehow, by chance or design, he came to the attention of Malagar, who
        engaged his services to track down the adventurers and retrieve the
        coveted invitation. And so it was that Coo crossed paths with our
        intrepid band of travelers, choosing to accompany them on their quest
        back to Malagar's realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        After securing the forgery, the team rendezvoused with Malagar, who had
        further instructions for them. They were to make their way to a small
        coastal town called Owl Ridge and hire a boat that would take them to
        the mysterious location known as Ibrido - the very place where the
        Secret Seven were said to be gathering. It was clear that the team's
        journey was far from over, and the danger they faced was only growing
        greater with each passing moment. With grim determination, they set out
        to complete their mission, fully aware that failure was not an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team's path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty, for they
        were now on their way to the foreboding Elder Forest. It was said that
        many who entered the forest never returned, and that the trees
        themselves were imbued with an ancient magic that could ensnare the
        unwary traveler. But the team had no choice but to press on, for their
        mission demanded it. As they entered the dark heart of the forest, they
        knew that the true test of their mettle was only just beginning. The
        Elder Forest held many secrets, and the team would soon discover that
        not all of them were benevolent.
