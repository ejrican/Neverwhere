      <h1>NeverWhere</h1>
      <p>
        In the mystical land of Shadowdale, a daring adventure awaits three
        unlikely companions - Kael, Brocc, and Apollo. Brocc, a youthful gnome
        and 5th level moon druid, joins forces with the towering mountain
        barbarian, Kael, and the charismatic human bard, Apollo, who boasts an
        impressive repertoire of stories and musical talents. Their journey
        begins when Aumry, a seasoned guide, leads them to meet Malagar, the
        Arch Mage of Waterdeep, who hires the team to negotiate the release of
        Pan the Gnome from the clutches of the nefarious Penny Eyesore, who has
        imprisoned him in the dark and dangerous sewers beneath Shadowdale.
      </p>
      <p>
        During their mission, the group encounters Rictor the Lucky, a human
        thief who reveals that their world is not as it seems, and introduces
        them to the powerful Witch of Shadowdale, Sylune, and the wizard
        protector, El Minister.

        As they navigate their way through the underground market, the team is
        able to secure Pan's freedom through shrewd negotiation. Kael even
        offers up some of his own cherished memories to ensure the safe release
        of both Pan and Rictor. However, their quest takes an unexpected turn
        when they discover that events in their world are being rewritten, and
        their journey leads them to Tyrus the Wall City. There, they find the
        wooden sword relic that they were tasked with retrieving, but Pan
        disappears with the sword, leaving the group to wonder about his
        motives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penny Eyesore, who had been trailing the team, comes to their aid during
        a fierce battle, and leads them north towards her sister, the Ice Queen.
        It turns out that Pan had delivered the sword to the Ice Queen, but
        Penny negotiates with her sibling for the relic's safe return and Pan's
        release. But a tragic mistake ensues when Brocc casts an Entanglement
        spell on Penny, causing her to inadvertently kill him. Apollo steps in
        to negotiate with Penny, offering up one of his own cherished memories
        to bring Brocc back to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group ultimately returns to Malagar, who unsheathes the wooden
        sword, freeing Sylune, El Minister, and Penny from their illusion. They
        learn that a sinister wizard named Pyatt has been manipulating time and
        space in an effort to find his lost love, drawing people from different
        times and places into their world. Malagar and the team realize that
        they need to stop Pyatt and restore reality. To do so, they seek out the
        Secret Seven, a group of powerful allies who may be able to help them.
        The team needs to attend a gathering where the Secret Seven are expected
        to appear, and Talim, a fierce female Drow freedom fighter, may hold the
        key to securing an invitation.

      <p>
        With danger lurking at every turn, the trio of Kael, Brocc, and Apollo
        must summon all their strength and courage to confront the challenges
        that await them on their perilous journey. Deep within the shadows of
        the Underdark, this team of adventurers stumbled upon two intriguing
        figures, Jai Kai, a devout human cleric and RaZaa, a towering Dragonborn
        who was abruptly whisked away by a higher being. Talim, a battered
        soldier, crossed paths with the team and informed them of her recent
        betrayal by Xander, a drow who absconded with six of her troops. In
        exchange for their help, she promised to provide the team with an
        invitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tracking Xander to the sewers in the northeast, the team brokered a
        deal, exchanging Talim's whereabouts for the magical invitation.
        However, they reneged on their promise and instead cut a deal with
        Xander, bartering the invitation for Talim's location.

        <h2>Talim</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        After delivering the invitation to Malagar, the team intended to take a
        hiatus, but their respite was short-lived. Summoned by Thurbal, the
        warden of Shadowdale, they were tasked with reconnoitering the abandoned
        tunnels beneath the castle. Their exploration encountered several
        obstacles, particularly the challenging Dark Elves, but the rumors of
        Talim's treachery spread like wildfire throughout the Underdark.
      </p>
      <p>
        During their perilous journey, the team stumbled upon a letter addressed
        to Talim on a dead Drow, detailing a faction that opposed the
        enslavement of others and hoped to unify the people. The team battled
        various foes, with Apollo's stealth and Brocc's markings on the wall
        aiding their progress. They even encountered undead ogres, with one
        wearing a vial of glowing liquid around his neck. Brocc transformed into
        a spider and snatched the vial from the ogre, hoping to use it against
        their adversaries. After throwing it at the remaining ogre, they
        discovered that it contained Penny Eyesore's blood, causing the ogre to
        grow into a towering monster. Dubbing himself as the Scion of Penny, the
        creature proved too powerful for the team until Brocc's thunderclap
        spell and Jai Kai's Eldith blast caused the ceiling to cave in on top of
        it. As they fled the scene, they stumbled upon Simon The Stone Breaker,
        a dwarf whose team had been decimated by the same glowing creature. The
        team spent several days in the Underdark, charting their progress and
        honing their skills in preparation for the next challenge that awaited
        them.

        For many long and grueling days, the team braved the dangers of the
        Under Dark, battling fearsome creatures and navigating the treacherous
        terrain. But in the end, it was one of their own who nearly spelled
        their doom. Zeek, one of Talim's so-called "children," had joined the
        team under false pretenses, masquerading as a guide and leading them
        into a deadly trap. Though they managed to survive, it came at a great
        cost, with each adventurer suffering serious injuries and one, Jai Kai,
        losing his life to the swarming enemies that dragged him away to be
        devoured. The team was able to make their way back to the surface, only
        to discover that they were not the only ones to have encountered a great
        danger in the Under Dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thurbal and his army met them at the exit, the entrance having been
        blasted wide open by a Green Glowing Monster. The creature had destroyed
        half of Thurbal's army before disappearing into the wilderness,
        referring to itself as The Scion of Penny. The team stayed silent about
        their own role in unleashing the monster, but their cover was soon blown
        by a Drow who recognized them and informed Thurbal of their involvement.

        Fearing persecution, the team was forced to flee to Shadyvale, a town on
        a different plane of existence where magic was taboo. They sought the
        help of Abel, a skilled forger, only to discover that he had died.
        Instead, they set their sights on his brother Babel, who was locked up
        in jail in Carbone. The team negotiated a deal with the Van Cross Family
        for his release, but the terms were steep: they had 24 hours to locate
        and deliver the body of Wilham, the Van Cross child, who had been
        murdered. Brocc managed to revive Wilham long enough to reveal that
        Katherine Chambers was guilty of his death, leading the Van Cross to
        order her execution. But when Katherine's spirit escaped and it was
        discovered that she was innocent, the team found themselves at odds with
        their former allies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the forgery in hand, the team met with Malagar, who instructed them
        to travel to Owl Ridge and hire a boat to take them to Ibrido, where the
        Secret Seven would be meeting. Their journey would take them through the
        Elder Forest, where they would face new dangers and challenges. And so,
        with heavy hearts and determined spirits, the team forged ahead, ready
        to face whatever lay ahead.
