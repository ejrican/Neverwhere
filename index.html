      <p>Brocc, a young gnome from Turlang's Woods, stands at a mere 4ft tall and weighs 40lbs. Despite his youth, at only 40 years old, gnomes have been known to live for centuries. Raised by The Half Gram tribe, a group of illusionist and herbal farmers, Brocc was appointed as an apprentice to a female forest gnome druid named Fidelma the Faithful. Under her guidance, Brocc learned the ways of the moon druid and lived as a hermit to become one with nature. He formed a close bond with an Elf Ranger, who gifted him a precious and important totem, but ultimately decided to leave his secluded lifestyle to explore the world and embark on new adventures. His first taste of the outside world was Pyatt's Neverwhere, a place he could never have imagined.</p>
